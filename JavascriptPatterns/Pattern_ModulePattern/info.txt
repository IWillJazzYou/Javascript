* Self-Contained module
    * every thing to do in my module is in my module
    * no global variables
    * if a module manages more than  one thing it should split up
* separation of concerns
* Dry code: dont repeat yourself
* efficient DOM usage
    * very few $(seleection)
* no memory leaks
    * all events can be unbound
